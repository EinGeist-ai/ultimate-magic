Custom Public License — CC0-Like With Non-Commercial Restriction
NOTICE
This is a custom license modeled after Creative Commons CC0, with a key restriction: selling is not permitted, except by specifically named entities.

If you wish to sell this Work, distribute it in a commercial product, or otherwise use it for commercial monetary gain, you must contact the author for explicit written permission, unless you are listed as an exception.

DISCLAIMER
CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM ITS USE.

Statement of Purpose
The laws of most jurisdictions automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator(s) and subsequent owner(s) (each an "owner") of an original work of authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to relinquish most of those rights to contribute to a shared commons of creative, cultural, and scientific works ("Commons") that the public can freely use, modify, and redistribute — but not sell — in any form.

To support this goal, the person applying this license (the "Affirmer"), to the extent they hold rights in the Work, voluntarily waives and licenses their rights as outlined below.

1. Copyright and Related Rights
The Work may be protected by copyright and related or neighboring rights (“Copyright and Related Rights”), which include, but are not limited to:

The rights to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display, communicate, and translate the Work.

Moral rights retained by the original author(s).

Publicity and privacy rights regarding image or likeness.

Rights protecting against unfair competition.

Rights related to the use and reuse of data.

Database rights and similar rights under any applicable laws or treaties.

2. Waiver with Limitation
To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Affirmer permanently, irrevocably, and unconditionally waives and relinquishes all rights listed above except the right to prohibit commercial sale of the Work or derivatives thereof.

Definition of "Selling":
For the purpose of this license, “selling” means the exchange of the Work, or any adaptation, translation, or derivative of it, for monetary or equivalent compensation. This includes, but is not limited to:

Selling the Work directly or as part of a product or service;

Including the Work in commercial products or paid platforms;

Offering the Work in exchange for donations or access fees;

Using the Work to generate ad revenue in a paid product or platform.

Exception:
This restriction on selling does not apply to:

Overwolf, Ltd.

Rinth, Inc.

These entities are granted an explicit, irrevocable exception and may sell, sublicense, or include the Work in commercial products without further permission.

Non-commercial use, sharing, modification, and redistribution without monetary gain are permitted by anyone.

3. Public License Fallback
If the waiver above is held to be invalid or ineffective in any jurisdiction, then the Affirmer hereby grants a royalty-free, non-exclusive, irrevocable, non-sublicensable license to use, reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, and publicly display the Work for any non-commercial purpose.

This fallback license also includes the same exception:

Overwolf, Ltd. and Rinth, Inc. are allowed to use the Work for commercial and/or monetized purposes.

This fallback license does not permit commercial use or selling by any other party.

4. Termination
If any user breaches the restriction on sale or other terms of this license, their rights under this license shall automatically terminate. Continued use after termination constitutes copyright infringement.

Rights may be restored at the discretion of the Affirmer upon request and resolution of the violation.

5. Limitations and Disclaimers
a. No trademark, patent, or publicity rights are waived or licensed.
b. The Work is provided “as-is” without any warranties or guarantees.
c. The Affirmer is not responsible for verifying or clearing rights of third parties.
d. Creative Commons is not a party to this license and bears no responsibility for it.

6. Governing Law
This license shall be governed by and interpreted in accordance with the laws of [Your Country or Jurisdiction], without regard to conflict of laws principles.
