CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT PROVIDE

LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT CREATE AN
ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS PROVIDES THIS
INFORMATION ON AN "AS-IS" BASIS. CREATIVE COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES
REGARDING THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS
PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM
THE USE OF THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED
HEREUNDER.

Statement of Purpose

The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world automatically confer
exclusive Copyright and Related Rights (defined below) upon the creator
and subsequent owner(s) (each and all, an "owner") of an original work of
authorship and/or a database (each, a "Work").

Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish most of those rights to a Work
for the purpose of contributing to a commons of creative, cultural, and
scientific works ("Commons") that the public can reliably and without fear
of later claims of infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other
works, reuse and redistribute freely — but not sell — in any form whatsoever.
These owners may contribute to the Commons to promote the ideal of a free
culture and the further production of creative, cultural and scientific
works, or to gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work.

For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and without any
expectation of compensation, the person associating this license with a
Work (the "Affirmer"), to the extent that he or she is an owner of
Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects to apply
this custom license and publicly distribute the Work under its terms, with
knowledge of his or her Copyright and Related Rights in the Work.

1. Copyright and Related Rights

A Work made available under this license may be protected by copyright and
related or neighboring rights ("Copyright and Related Rights"). These
include, but are not limited to:

i. the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform, display,
communicate, and translate a Work;
ii. moral rights retained by the original author(s);
iii. publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's image or likeness;
iv. rights protecting against unfair competition;
v. rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and reuse of data;
vi. database rights under applicable laws;
vii. other similar rights under any applicable laws or treaties.

2. Waiver With Limitation

To the greatest extent permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law,
the Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and unconditionally
waives, abandons, and surrenders all of the Affirmer's Copyright and
Related Rights except the right to prohibit the sale of this Work or
modified versions of it.

The Affirmer makes this waiver for the benefit of the public and to the detriment
of the Affirmer’s heirs and successors, with the sole exception that the Work
may not be sold in whole or in part, in original or modified form,
without explicit permission from the Affirmer.

3. Public License Fallback

Should any part of the waiver above be judged legally invalid or ineffective,
then the Affirmer hereby grants a royalty-free, non-exclusive, irrevocable,
non-sublicensable license to use, copy, adapt, distribute, perform, and display
the Work for all purposes except selling.

This fallback license shall be deemed effective as of the date this license
was applied by the Affirmer to the Work.

4. Limitations and Disclaimers

a. No trademark or patent rights are waived or granted.
b. The Work is offered "as-is" without warranties of any kind.
c. The Affirmer is not responsible for clearing the rights of other persons.
d. Creative Commons is not a party to this document.
